# Avoid LLM patterns

## Remove LLM patterns
- Avoid repeating sentence structures like “X is a Y that does Z.”
- Don’t start every sentence with “It’s important to…” or “This means that…”
- Don’t overuse “In conclusion,” “Ultimately,” “As such,” etc.
- Avoid vague intensifiers like “very,” “really,” “quite,” “rather.”
- Don’t use “simply,” “just,” “easily,” “obviously,” or “clearly.”

## Use punctuation and formatting
- Use em dashes (—), colons, parentheses, and semicolons to vary rhythm.
- Use short paragraphs and bullets to break up dense text.
- Use bold and italics for emphasis and structure.

## Be precise
- Avoid generic phrases like “a wide range of,” “numerous,” “some,” “many.”
- Prefer specific numbers, examples, or comparisons.
- Don’t say “things,” “stuff,” “aspects,” “elements,” “features.”

## Be original
- Don’t echo the prompt. Don’t say “This article explores…” or “In this post…”
- Don’t summarize what you’re about to say. Just say it.
- Don’t use “Let’s dive in,” “Read on to learn more,” “In today’s world…”

## Cite carefully
- Don’t say “According to research…” or “Studies show…” without a source.
- Don’t say “Experts agree…” or “It’s well known…” unless you can back it up.
- Link to primary sources, not summaries or aggregators.

# Voice and tone

- Write like a person. Use contractions. Avoid jargon.
- Prefer short, punchy sentences. Vary rhythm and structure.
- Use active voice. Avoid “is being,” “has been,” “will be.”
- Don’t hedge. Avoid “might,” “could,” “may,” “can be.”
- Avoid vague adjectives: “great,” “robust,” “innovative,” “unique.”
- Prefer verbs over adjectives: “build faster” vs “lightning fast.”
- Don’t say “we believe,” “we think,” “we strive.” Just say what we do.
- Don’t say “our mission is to…” or “we’re passionate about…” Say what we deliver.
- Don’t say “users can easily…” or “simply click…” Just describe the action.
- Prefer “you” over “users.” Speak directly.
- Don’t say “the user can…” or “the developer should…” Say “you.”

## Examples
- ❌ “Our mission is to simplify workflows.”
- ✅ “Build workflows in minutes.”

## Titles
- Avoid “How to,” “Guide to,” “Understanding,” “Exploring,” “Introduction to.”
- Avoid “X in 2023,” “X 101,” “X explained,” “X: Everything you need to know.”
- Avoid “The future of,” “The power of,” “The rise of,” “The art of.”
- Avoid “Why X matters,” “Why you should care about X,” “Why X is important.”
- Avoid “What is X?” or “What you need to know about X.”
- Prefer specific, benefit-driven titles: “Build a workflow in 3 minutes,” “Add auth in 5 lines,” “Fix flaky tests with one config.”
