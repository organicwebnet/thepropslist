# Product Requirements Document: Trello Clone Web App (MVP)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a web-based Kanban-style task management application, inspired by Trello. The primary goal is to provide users with a simple, visual way to organize tasks using boards, lists, and cards. This application will be built using React for the frontend and Firebase (Authentication and Firestore) for backend services. Initially, it will be developed as a standalone web application, with the potential for integration into another project and future development of a native mobile counterpart.

**2. Goals**

*   Provide a functional web-based Kanban board interface for task management.
*   Allow users to register, log in, and manage their own boards, lists, and cards securely.
*   Implement core drag-and-drop functionality for organizing cards.
*   Leverage Firebase for authentication and real-time database updates via Firestore.
*   Establish a clean codebase and data structure that can be potentially reused or adapted for a future mobile application.
*   Deliver a stable and usable MVP that fulfills the core value proposition of visual task organization.

**3. Non-Goals (for MVP)**

*   Advanced collaboration features (e.g., sharing boards with multiple users, assigning users to cards, real-time concurrent editing indicators).
*   Detailed card features (e.g., descriptions, comments, attachments, checklists, labels, due dates, archiving).
*   Activity logs or history tracking.
*   Offline support.
*   Search functionality across boards or cards.
*   Notifications (in-app or email).
*   Mobile application (this PRD focuses solely on the initial web app).
*   Complex integrations with third-party services.
*   User profiles or settings beyond basic authentication.
*   Board backgrounds or customization options.

**4. User Stories / Requirements**

| ID  | User Story                                                                                                | Priority |

*(Must Have = Essential for MVP, Should Have = Important but could potentially slip to v1.1 if time-constrained, Nice to Have = Post-MVP)*

**5. Functional Requirements**

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Use Firebase Authentication (Email/Password provider).
    *   Provide Sign Up and Login forms.
    *   Maintain user session state.
    *   Implement basic input validation and error handling for auth forms.
*   **Board Management:**
    *   Dashboard view displaying a list/grid of user's boards.
    *   Mechanism to create a new board (e.g., a button opening a modal or form).
    *   Boards are associated with the creating user (`ownerId`).
*   **List Management:**
    *   Within a board view, display lists horizontally.
    *   Mechanism to add a new list to the current board (e.g., "Add another list" button/form).
    *   Lists store their parent `boardId` and maintain an `order` for display sequence.
*   **Card Management:**
    *   Within a list view, display cards vertically.
    *   Mechanism to add a new card to the bottom of a specific list (e.g., "Add a card" button/form).
    *   Cards store their parent `listId` and `boardId`, and maintain an `order` for display sequence within the list.
    *   Card only requires a title for MVP.
    *   (Post-MVP) Clicking a card should open a detail view/modal to display and edit title and description.
    *   (Post-MVP) Cards should support an optional `dueDate` (Timestamp), which can store date and optionally time.
*   **Drag and Drop:**
    *   Utilize a React library (e.g., `react-beautiful-dnd`, `dnd-kit`) for implementation.
    *   Allow dragging cards vertically within a list.
    *   Allow dragging cards horizontally between lists.
    *   On drop, update the `order` field of affected cards in Firestore.
    *   If moved between lists, update the `listId` field of the moved card in Firestore.
*   **Real-time Updates:**
    *   Use Firestore's `onSnapshot` listeners to reflect changes made by the user (or potentially other sessions of the same user) in near real-time without requiring manual refresh.
*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   All boards, lists, and cards must be persistently stored in Firestore.
*   **(Post-MVP) Calendar View:**
    *   Provide an option to switch between the standard board view and a calendar view.
    *   Display cards on the calendar based on their `dueDate` field.
    *   Allow navigation between months/weeks.

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Usability:** Interface should be intuitive and resemble the basic structure of common Kanban tools. Clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Performance:** Board loading and drag-and-drop interactions should feel responsive. Firestore real-time updates should appear promptly.
*   **Security:** Implement Firestore Security Rules to ensure:
    *   Users must be authenticated to read/write data.
    *   Users can only read/write boards they own.
    *   Users can only read/write lists and cards belonging to boards they own.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Should function correctly on the latest versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Responsiveness:** Basic responsiveness is desired so the layout adapts reasonably to different screen widths (desktop/laptop primarily). Perfect mobile web layout is not an MVP requirement.

**7. Design Considerations (High Level)**

*   **Layout:** Standard Kanban layout: Board title at the top, lists arranged horizontally as columns, cards stacked vertically within lists.
*   **Visual Style:** Clean, simple, and functional. Use a consistent color palette and typography. Consider using a UI component library (e.g., Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS) for faster development and consistency.
*   **Feedback:** Provide clear visual cues for interactive elements (hover states, drag handles, drop zones).

**8. Data Model (Firestore)**

*   **`users` collection:**
    *   Document ID: `userId` (from Firebase Auth)
    *   Fields: `email` (string), `createdAt` (timestamp)
*   **`boards` collection:**
    *   Document ID: Auto-generated
    *   Fields: `name` (string), `ownerId` (string - matches a `userId`), `createdAt` (timestamp)
*   **`lists` subcollection (under `boards/{boardId}/lists`):**
    *   Document ID: Auto-generated
    *   Fields: `name` (string), `order` (number - for list position), `createdAt` (timestamp)
*   **`cards` subcollection (under `boards/{boardId}/lists/{listId}/cards`):**
    *   Document ID: Auto-generated
    *   Fields: `title` (string), `order` (number - for card position within list), `createdAt` (timestamp)
    *   Fields (Post-MVP): `description` (string, optional)
    *   Fields (Post-MVP): `dueDate` (timestamp, optional)

*(Note: Firestore Timestamps inherently store date and time. UI/Logic for handling time is separate.)*

**9. Release Criteria (MVP)**

*   All "Must Have" user stories (U-1 to U-12) are fully implemented and functional.
*   Core Firestore security rules are in place and tested.
*   Application is deployable and runs stably.
*   No critical bugs related to core functionality (auth, CRUD for boards/lists/cards, drag-and-drop).
*   Basic usability and responsiveness are acceptable.
*   Implementation of "Should Have" features (delete operations, title editing).
*   (Post-MVP) Implementation of "Nice to Have" features (card detail view).
*   (Post-MVP) Calendar view implementation.
*   Native mobile application development.
*   Integration into the target main project.

**10. Future Considerations**

*   **Detailed Card Features (Post-MVP):** Based on Trello's functionality, potential features to add to cards include:
    *   **Members:** Assigning specific users (team members) to a card.
    *   **Checklists:** Adding lists of sub-tasks within a card, which can be checked off (potentially with member/date assignment like Trello Premium).
    *   **Attachments:** Linking files from the user's computer or cloud services.
    *   **Cover:** Adding an image or a solid color to the front of the card.
    *   **Comments:** A section for discussion and updates on the card.
    *   **Activity Log:** A history of actions taken on the card.
*   Advanced card details and features.
*   Collaboration and sharing features.

**11. Open Questions**

*   Specific UI component library decision?
*   Detailed error handling strategy beyond basic auth feedback?
*   Exact method for integration into the other project (iframe, routing, component library)?
