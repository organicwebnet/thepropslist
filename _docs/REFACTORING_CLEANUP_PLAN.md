- [x] /public/ (web public assets)
- [x] /_docs/ (documentation)
- [x] /package.json, /tsconfig.json, /App.tsx, /index.js (core project files)
- [x] /README.md (project documentation)
- [x] /yarn.lock, /package-lock.json (keep one, prefer yarn if using yarn)
- [x] /babel.config.cjs, /metro.config.cjs, /react-native.config.js (build configs)
- [x] /global.css, /tailwind.config.js, /postcss.config.js (styling configs)
- [x] /firebase.json, /eas.json, /cors.json (platform/service configs)
- [x] /serviceAccountKey.json, /google-services.json (local only, never commit to public repo)
- [x] All files/folders in app/ and src/ not listed above for deletion (review for cleanup/optimization)

## C. General Cleanup Steps
1. Remove all commented-out code. **(Complete)**
2. Delete unused imports and variables. **(Complete)**
3. Remove legacy/duplicate files. **(Complete)**
4. Standardize formatting and naming. **(Complete)**
5. Add/Update README and documentation. **(Complete)**

## D. Refactoring Best Practices Checklist
- [x] No commented-out code in production
- [x] All files use consistent formatting (Prettier/ESLint)
- [x] Only one source of truth for each feature
- [x] All context/providers are minimal and clear
- [x] All forms/components are DRY and modular
