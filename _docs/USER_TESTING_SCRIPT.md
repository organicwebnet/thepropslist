# Role-Based Data Filtering - User Testing Script

## üéØ **Testing Objectives**

This script will help you test the role-based data filtering system to ensure:
1. Different user roles see appropriate prop information
2. Quick actions work correctly for each role
3. The UI is intuitive and responsive
4. All features function as expected

## üìã **Pre-Test Setup**

### **1. Create Test Users with Different Roles**

You'll need to create test users with the following roles:
- **God User** (full access)
- **Props Supervisor** (show management)
- **Stage Manager** (operational focus)
- **Prop Maker** (construction focus)
- **Art Director** (design/budget focus)
- **Assistant Stage Manager** (logistics focus)
- **Props Supervisor Assistant** (assistant role)
- **Viewer** (read-only)

### **2. Create Test Props**

Create at least 5-10 test props with various:
- Categories (furniture, hand props, set dressing, etc.)
- Statuses (available_in_storage, in_use_on_set, under_maintenance, etc.)
- Locations (Storage Room A, Backstage Left, On Stage, etc.)
- Different field values (prices, materials, maintenance notes, etc.)

### **3. Test Environment**

- Use a dedicated test show/production
- Ensure you have props with different statuses and locations
- Have at least one prop with images
- Include props with maintenance notes and safety information

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Role-Based Data Visibility**

**Objective**: Verify that each role sees appropriate prop information

#### **Steps for Each Role:**

1. **Log in as the test user**
2. **Navigate to the props list**
3. **Verify the role indicator** shows the correct role name
4. **Check visible fields** for each prop card:
   - Are the fields appropriate for the role?
   - Are sensitive fields (like prices) hidden for non-financial roles?
   - Are operational fields (like locations) visible for operational roles?

#### **Expected Results by Role:**

| Role | Should See | Should NOT See |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Stage Manager** | Location, Status, Act/Scene, Safety Notes, Maintenance Notes | Prices, Replacement Costs, Purchase URLs |
| **Prop Maker** | Materials, Dimensions, Special Requirements, Construction Notes | Financial info, Location details, Act/Scene |
| **Art Director** | Images, Prices, Source, Design Requirements, Budget info | Maintenance, Location, Technical details |
| **Props Supervisor** | Everything (full access) | Nothing hidden |
| **God User** | Everything + System controls | Nothing hidden |
| **Viewer** | Basic info only (Name, Description, Category, Status, Images) | Most detailed fields |
