- Each show has multiple acts and scenes
- Props are specific to scenes and must be available at the right time
- Shows can run for weeks, months, or years

**Scenes & Acts**
- **Act**: Major division of a play (Act 1, Act 2, etc.)
- **Scene**: Smaller division within an act
- Props are often specific to certain scenes
- Scene changes happen during performances

**Production Timeline**
