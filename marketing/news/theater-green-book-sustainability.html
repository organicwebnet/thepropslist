      <article class="content">
        <p>The theater industry is embracing environmental responsibility through the Theater Green Book initiative, a comprehensive framework for sustainable theater production. This groundbreaking program is transforming how theaters approach everything from set construction to audience engagement, proving that artistic excellence and environmental consciousness can go hand in hand.</p>

        <h2>What is the Theater Green Book?</h2>
        
        <p>The Theater Green Book is a collaborative initiative that provides theaters with practical guidance, tools, and standards for reducing their environmental impact. Developed by industry leaders, sustainability experts, and theater practitioners, it offers a structured approach to making theater production more eco-friendly without compromising artistic quality.</p>

        <p>The initiative addresses three core areas of theater production:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build:</strong> Sustainable set construction, prop making, and technical elements</li>
          <li><strong>Rehearse:</strong> Eco-friendly rehearsal processes and administrative practices</li>
          <li><strong>Present:</strong> Sustainable performance delivery and audience engagement</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Environmental Challenge in Theater</h2>

        <p>Theater production has traditionally been resource-intensive, with significant environmental impacts:</p>

        <h3>Material Consumption</h3>
        <p>Set construction often involves large quantities of wood, metal, paint, and other materials. Many of these materials are used for single productions and then discarded, creating substantial waste.</p>

        <h3>Energy Usage</h3>
        <p>Theater buildings consume significant energy for lighting, heating, cooling, and technical equipment. Large-scale productions can have carbon footprints comparable to small industrial operations.</p>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p>Touring productions, material deliveries, and audience travel contribute to transportation emissions. International tours can have particularly high carbon footprints.</p>

        <h3>Waste Generation</h3>
        <p>From set pieces to costumes to administrative materials, theater productions generate substantial waste. Much of this waste ends up in landfills rather than being recycled or reused.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The Numbers: Theater's Environmental Impact</h3>
          <p>A typical West End production can generate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>50-100 tons of set materials per production</li>
            <li>2,000-5,000 kWh of energy per performance</li>
            <li>500-1,000 kg of waste per week</li>
            <li>Significant water usage for cleaning and maintenance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Theater Green Book aims to reduce these impacts by 30-50% through systematic changes.</p>
        </div>
