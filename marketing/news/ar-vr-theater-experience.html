        <p>Augmented and virtual reality technologies are revolutionizing theater by creating immersive experiences that blur the line between audience and performance. These cutting-edge technologies are enabling new forms of storytelling and audience engagement that were previously impossible in traditional theater settings.</p>

        <h2>The Rise of Immersive Theater Technology</h2>
        
        <p>AR and VR technologies are transforming theater from a passive viewing experience into an interactive, immersive journey. Audiences can now step into the world of the play, interact with characters, and influence the narrative in ways that traditional theater cannot provide.</p>

        <h3>Augmented Reality in Theater</h3>
        <p>AR overlays digital content onto the real world, allowing audiences to see additional layers of information, characters, or environments through their smartphones or AR glasses. This technology is being used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide additional context and backstory</li>
          <li>Create interactive elements within the performance space</li>
          <li>Enable personalized experiences for different audience members</li>
          <li>Bridge the gap between digital and physical storytelling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Virtual Reality Experiences</h3>
        <p>VR creates completely immersive digital environments where audiences can explore the world of the play from within. This technology enables:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>360-degree storytelling experiences</li>
          <li>Impossible environments and scenarios</li>
          <li>Personalized narrative paths</li>
          <li>Remote theater experiences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Case Studies: AR and VR in Action</h2>
